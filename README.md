The project is about a challenge I received during a job application process and it is related to US cities.

## The Challenge

- Design individual web pages for each city.
- Fetch data like population, area, and attractions using an API.
- Summarize the data using an AI tool.
- Integrate the summaries into the web pages.

## My Approach

Design: I created a clean and responsive web page template to display city information.
Data Acquisition: I used a public API to retrieve relevant data for the US cities.
Data Processing: I integrated an AI tool to analyze the fetched data and generate summaries for each city.
Presentation: I incorporated the AI-generated summaries into the corresponding city web pages.

## Beyond the Basics

- I ensured the code was well-documented, followed best practices, and handled potential errors gracefully.
- The web pages are accessible and responsive to different screen sizes.
- All the results are cached by demand. Once a user sees a page never accessed before, he will see a loading fallback, but after the result will be cached and everyone will see instant results when the page is accessed.
